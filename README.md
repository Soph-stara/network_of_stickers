This is the analysis of sources of stickers as a medium of places of commons in light of Silvia Federicies concept of places of commons and practices of commoning.

„If commoning has any meaning, it must be the production of ourselves as a common subject. This is how we must understand the slogan ‘no commons without community.’ But ‘community’ has to be intended not as a gated reality, a grouping of people joined by exclusive interests separating them from others, as with communities formed on the basis of religion or ethnicity, but rather as a quality of relations, a principle of cooperation and of responsibility to each other and to the earth, the forests, the seas, the animals.” (Silvia Federici, Re-enchanting The World: Feminism and the Politics of the Commons (2018), 110.)
